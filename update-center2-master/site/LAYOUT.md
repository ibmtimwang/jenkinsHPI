# Site layout

The update center server at `updates.jenkins.io` contains the following pieces.

Many of these depend on how the configurable `update-center2` is invoked, so this information is based on the presets provided by `./site/publish.sh` and `./site/generate.sh`.


## General update site contents

This section describes the general content of update sites.
This is a combination of files required to support the tiered update site system, as well as additional files specific to update sites for secondary purposes.

* `updates/` contains is a copy of/link to tool installer metadata.

Users configuring specific versioned update sites, or still using the `stable/` update site will need this directory to ensure tool installer metadata can be downloaded.

For details, see [`DownloadService.Downloadable`](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/core/src/main/java/hudson/model/DownloadService.java)).
[`crawler`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/crawler) is populating this directory.

The following sections describe the files (sometimes) present in an update site that are generated by this tool.


### Update center JSON(ish) files

These files contain update site metadata.
These variants exist for historical purposes.

* `update-center.json` contains JSONP (with callback wrapper) on the first and last lines.
  This is the file actually downloaded by Jenkins 2.200+.
* `update-center.json.html` contains HTML with JSON wrapped in JS.
  This used to be downloaded using browser-based metadata download (deprecated in 2015, removed in 2.200)
* `update-center.actual.json` (actual JSON for programmatic clients)


### Latest releases directory

`latest/` is a directory with two files:
 
 * a virtual directory listing (`index.html`) linking to the latest releases of core and all plugins in the update site
 * a `.htaccess` file with redirects making the directory look as if this directory contained those files.


### Latest core file

`latestCore.txt` is a text file with core version offered by the update site.
This file is used by jenkins-infra/jenkins.io to determine the latest version offered.


### Plugin documentation URLs JSON file

`plugin-documentation-urls.json` is a JSON file mapping plugin IDs to documentation URLs.
This exists to support plugins.jenkins.io, as `update-center.*` files only link to plugins.jenkins.io.


### Plugin versions JSON file

`plugin-versions.json` only exists in the `current/` update site and exists to support the top-level directory file.
This file supports programmatic plugin installation scenarios (e.g. Configuration-as-Code, Docker) and only contains the content necessary to support those use cases.


### Release history JSON file

`release-history.json` only exists in the `current/` update site and exists to support the top-level directory file.
This file powers the file https://jenkins.io/releases.rss which is used by https://twitter.com/jenkins_release


## Top-level update site

Jenkins is distributed with the update site `https://updates.jenkins.io/update-center.json` preconfigured.
The top level directory provides that file and several others.

The top level update site will forward requests to the best matching _tiered_ update site, or the `current` update site based on the `version` query parameter sent by Jenkins.

The files in this directory are copies of/symlinks to `current` to create clickable links.
Actual requests are redirected to tiered sites, or the `current` site (with no query parameters).
This way, at least the file properties shown in the directory listing match the eventually served file after clicking the link.


## Regular tiered update sites (LTS and weekly)

Directories with names containing Jenkins LTS baselines like `2.204` are version specific update sites.

* `2.204/` contains the tiered update site for Jenkins 2.204 and _similar_ weekly releases not matching an LTS baseline.
* `stable-2.204/` contains the tiered update site for Jenkins 2.204.x.

Each of these update sites only offer plugins compatible with the respective baseline, as well as the newest weekly or LTS release, depending on the variant (LTS or weekly).
This increases the usefulness of the update sites to users of slightly older releases of Jenkins, as they won't regularly be offered incompatible releases of plugins.

The Jenkins project publishes a limited, fixed number of tiered update sites to encourage users to regularly update Jenkins. 

```
2.204/
├── latestCore.txt                   (Unused, may be removed)
├── update-center.actual.json
├── update-center.json
├── update-center.json.html
└── updates  ->  ../updates
stable-2.204/
├── latestCore.txt                   (Unused, may be removed)
├── update-center.actual.json
├── update-center.json
├── update-center.json.html
└── updates  ->  ../updates
```

Redirect rules will forward requests to the top-level update site files to the most appropriate tiered update site, or `current/`:

* Releases older than the oldest supported baseline will be served the oldest update site (LTS or weekly).
* Weekly releases between two supported LTS baselines will be served the next lower weekly update site.
  For example, if the newest supported LTS baseline is 2.222, then Jenkins 2.210 will get the 2.204 weekly update site.
* Weekly releases newer than the most recent LTS baseline will be served the `current/` update site.

As a side effect, only the exact weekly matching the most recent LTS baseline will be served that update site, any older version will be downgraded to the previous baseline, any newer version will be updated to `current/`

Symlinks to the top level `updates/` directory exist in all tiered update sites in case of bad configurations, e.g. when administrators manually select a specific update site, unaware of the version redirect.

<!-- latestCore.txt and latest/ exist, but that's a relic of how tiered update sites are just re-runs of the full update site -->


## Current update site

The directory `current` contains an update site without Jenkins version restrictions, offering the newest releases of Jenkins (weekly) and plugins.

```
current/
├── latest                           (supports top-level directory, may be moved)
│   ├── .htaccess                    (supports top-level directory, may be moved)
│   └── index.html                   (supports top-level directory, may be moved)
├── latestCore.txt
├── plugin-documentation-urls.json   (supports top-level file, may be moved)
├── plugin-versions.json             (supports top-level file, may be moved)
├── release-history.json             (supports top-level file, may be moved)
├── update-center.actual.json
├── update-center.json
├── update-center.json.html
└── updates  ->  ../updates
```


## Stable update site

```
stable/
├── latestCore.txt
├── update-center.actual.json
├── update-center.json
├── update-center.json.html
└── updates  ->  ../updates
```

This is a copy of/symlink to the LTS update site for the most recent LTS baseline.
The top-level `.htaccess` file forwards requests to the latest `stable-x.xxx` update site.

It exists for compatibility with older LTS masters that explicitly configure this URL as their update center and is also used by the jenkins-infra/jenkins.io build to determine the current LTS release (`latestCore.txt`).


## Experimental update site

Regular update site filter out version numbers containing `alpha` and `beta`.
This is an update site that users can use to download those release.
Otherwise, this is similar to `current/` in that no version caps exist.

```
experimental/
├── update-center.actual.json
├── update-center.json
├── update-center.json.html
└── updates  ->  ../updates
```

## Downloads directory

This directory contains a directory tree:

```
download/
├── plugins/
│   └── (pluginName)/
│       └── index.html
└── war/
    └── index.html
```

Each `index.html` file contains a list of links to `.war` (for core) and `.hpi` (for plugins) files.
Notably, all links apparently go to the _same_ directory and take e.g. the form `/download/war/2.2.204.6/jenkins.war`.
This is handled through the _top-level_ `.htaccess` file which redirects such download requests to the mirrors site.

## Top-level `.htaccess` file

The top-level `.htaccess` file is created by `generate-htaccess.sh` and implements the following redirects:

* Redirects from top-level update center files to tiered update sites (or `current`).
* Redirects from `stable/` to the latest LTS update site.
* Redirects from top-level release history and plugin versions JSON files to the real files in `current`
* Redirects for any other `.json` / `.json.html` files (i.e. tool downloader metadata in `updates/`) to the mirrors network. <!-- does this even work / matter? -->
* Redirects for `.war` and `.hpi` files in the `download/` directory tree to the mirrors network.
